Title: Student Record Management System

Objective:
Create a simple command-line program that allows users to manage student records
using object-oriented principles, control structures, and input/output handling in Java.


Requirements:

Create a Student class to represent student information with the following attributes:

Student ID (integer)
First Name (String)
Last Name (String)
Exam Score (double)


Lastname is quaranteed to be unique!

Implement a StudentRecordManager class that contains ArrayList of Student objects.
This class should provide the following functionalities:

Add a new student record. DONE
Display all student records. DONE
Search for a student by ID and display their information. DONE

Use the Scanner class to take user input for various operations. DONE

Bonus: Update a student's information (last name or Exam Score) by their ID. Done
Bonus: Delete a student record by ID. Done

Implement proper input validation to ensure that user inputs are within reasonable bounds
(e.g., Exam Score should be between 0.0 and 100.0). DONE

Use control structures like loops (e.g., for displaying all records)
and conditionals (e.g., for error handling and menu choices). DONE

Ensure data encapsulation by using private instance variables and appropriate getter and setter
methods in the Student class. DONE

Also, a class -- StudentFileHandler -- which should read the values from a given file in src/main/resources. Skip invalid score values. 

It also should write a file per exam score grade for a given list of students:

  Upper		 Lower	Grade
100,00 %	 87,50 %	1
 87,49 %	 75,00 %	2
 74,99 %	 62,50 %	3
 62,49 %	 50,00 %	4
 49,99 %	  0,00 %	5
 
 Use an appropriate looping mechanism to generate the files.
